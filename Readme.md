# Smasnug Notes
A lightweight launcher that temporarily disguises your Windows machine as a Samsung Galaxy Book by modifying Windows registry settings during app startup, just for the duration of the system check when Samsung Notes are being launched.

## Installation



1) [Download the Launcher here (Releases page)](https://github.com/kubaracek/SmasnugNotes/releases/download/v0.0.4/weallonsamsung.exe)
2) Start the app. You will be greeted by Microsft Defender asking if you really want to run the app as it's downloaded from the internet. Click **More Info** and **Run Anyway**.
3) If you have Microsoft notes already installed through Microsoft Store, it will just launch, otherwise the Launcher can install it for you.
4) Enjoy!
