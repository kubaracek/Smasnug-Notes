# Smasnug Notes
A lightweight launcher for Samsung Notes that temporarily disguises your Windows machine as a Samsung Galaxy Book by modifying Windows registry during app startup.

## How to run Samsung Notes on Windows

1) [Download the Launcher here (Releases page)](https://github.com/kubaracek/Smasnug-Notes/releases/download/v0.0.7/Smasnug.Notes.exe)
2) Start the Smasnug Notes app. You will be greeted by Microsoft Defender asking if you really want to run the app as it's downloaded from the internet. Click **More Info** and **Run Anyway** to run the program.
3) If you have Microsoft notes already installed through Microsoft Store, it will just launch, otherwise the Launcher can install it for you.
4) Enjoy!
