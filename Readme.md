# Smasnug Notes â€“ Run Samsung Notes on Windows

Run **Samsung Notes** on your **Windows PC** with Smasnug Notes, a lightweight launcher that enables Samsung Notes functionality by temporarily modifying your system to resemble a **Samsung Galaxy Book**. This allows Samsung Notes to bypass its device restrictions.

## How to Run Samsung Notes on Windows

Follow these steps to get **Samsung Notes running on your Windows device**:

1. **[Download the Smasnug Notes Launcher here](https://github.com/kubaracek/Smasnug-Notes/releases/download/v0.0.8/Smasnug.Notes.exe)** (Releases page).
2. Launch the Smasnug Notes app. You might encounter a security warning from **Microsoft Defender** due to downloading from the internet. Select **More Info** and click **Run Anyway** to proceed.
3. If you already have **Samsung Notes installed** from the Microsoft Store, the launcher will simply start it up. If not, Smasnug Notes will guide you through the installation process.
4. Once installed, you're all set to use Samsung Notes on your Windows machine!

## How to Download Samsung Notes on Windows

There are two ways to get **Samsung Notes** on your PC:

Please note: **Samsung Notes is device-locked** to Samsung hardware, meaning it won't work on non-Samsung devices without the Smasnug Notes utility.
